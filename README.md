# `PKAE_Timer` Library by PKAE Electronics

This class is a simple timer implementation that allows you to check if a certain amount of time has passed and optionally reset the timer. It can be useful for various timing-related tasks in embedded systems or other applications.

## `PKAE_Timer` Constructor

The constructor initializes the timer with an optional *initial delay*. If no delay is provided, it defaults to 0.

It sets the member variable `_delay` to the specified delay, initializes `nStarted` with the current time using the `millis()` function, and sets `nLastStarted` and `nCount` to 0.

Example:

```c++
	PKAE_Timer Flash_LED(500);
```

The above line defines a timer instance called `Flash_LED` and the delay is set to `500 milliseconds`.The count down starts the moment the instance is created.

## `IsTimeUp()` Function

The `IsTimeUp` function checks if the specified time has elapsed since the timer was last started.
It calculates the effective delay to check against as the maximum of the fixed delay `_delay` and a dynamic delay `nDynamicDelay`.
If the **elapsed time is greater than the effective delay**, it returns **true** indicating that the *time is up*.
If `lReset` is true, it increments the count `nCount`, updates `nLastStarted` to the previous start time, and sets `nStarted` to the current time

Example:

```c++
	if (Flash_LED.IsTimeUp()) {
		// put code here e.g. toggle the LED state On/Off.
	}
```

This will execute the code with in the curly braces whatever the timer (`500m/s` in our example) is reached. The timer automatically resets itself to start again.

You can pass an optional dynamic delay to check if an alternative duration has lapsed or not.

Example:

```c++
	if (Flash_LED.IsTimeUp(250)) {
		// put code here to execute if 250m/s has lapsed. 
	}
```

You can also pass an optional boolean expression to determine if the timer is reset or not. Handy if you wanted to temporarily stop the flashing for example.

Example:

```c++
	if (Flash_LED.IsTimeUp(250,false)) {
		// put code here to execute if 250m/s has lapsed. The timer will not reset.
	}
```

## `Reset()` Function

The `Reset` function resets the timer by updating `nLastStarted` to the previous start time and setting `nStarted` to the current time using `millis()``.

Example:

```c++
	Flash_LED.Reset();
```

This will effectively restart the timer counter for the Flash_LED timer instance.

## Member Variable `.nCount`

Retains a counter of the number of iterations that the timer instance has triggered. 

Example:

```c++
	xCount=Flash_LED.nCount;
```

`xCount` will store the number of times this timer has triggered,


## Member Variable `.nStarted`

Retains the `millis()` reading at the time in `millis` that the timer was started (either by its initial creation or by its last reset).

Example:

```c++
	xStarted=Flash_LED.nStarted;
```

`xStarted` will store when the last timer started for this timer instance. i.e. the `millis()` reading at the time it last initiated.


## Member Variable `.nLastStarted`

Retains the `millis()` reading of the previous time timer was started. 

Example:

```c++
	xLastStarted=Flash_LED.nLastStarted;
```

`xLastStarted` will store when the previous timer started for this timer instance. i.e. the `millis()` reading at the time it previously initiated.
